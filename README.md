# websocket-chat

This is a practical challenge about **WebSockets** with Python.

_The initial idea was to only build the backend with Python and use a HTML template to render the chat, but I decided to build the frontend with React and Next.js to make the application more dynamic and interactive, and also to put my knowledge to practice with these technologies._

## Dependencies (backend)
### Flask
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Flask is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and fine-grained control, making it a popular choice for web developers.

### Flask-SocketIO
Flask-SocketIO is an extension that adds Socket.IO support to your Flask application. Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the browser and the server. This is achieved through the use of WebSockets, which provide a persistent connection between the client and the server, allowing for real-time updates without the need for page reloads.

### Flask-SQLAlchemy
Flask-SQLAlchemy is a library that provides support for SQLAlchemy (a Python library for working with databases) in a Flask application. SQLAlchemy is a popular Python library for working with databases, and Flask-SQLAlchemy provides a simple way to use it in a Flask application.

### Flask-Migrate
Flask-Migrate is a library that provides support for database migrations in a Flask application. Database migrations are a way to keep track of changes to your database schema, allowing you to update your database structure without affecting your application's data.

## Dependencies (frontend)
### React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to create interactive and dynamic web applications. React allows you to build reusable UI components and manage the state of your application efficiently.

### Next.js
Next.js is a framework for building server-side rendered React applications. It is used to create fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. Next.js provides a set of tools and features that help you build modern web applications, including server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and built-in support for routing.

### Socket.IO-Client
Socket.IO-Client is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the browser and the server. It is used to create a connection between the client and the server, allowing for real-time updates without the need for page reloads.

### Lucide-React
Lucide-React is an icon library for React. It is used to create beautiful and functional icons for your application. Lucide-React provides a set of tools and features that help you create beautiful and functional icons for your application.
